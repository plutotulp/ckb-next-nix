* Nix derivations and flake for ckb-next
This repository packages up [[https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next][ckb-next: RGB driver for Linux]] for Nix.
Contents:

- pkgs/ckb-next/default.nix :: Derivation for a stable version of
  ckb-next. This includes the daemon, systemd service unit and
  accompanying udev rule.
- pkgs/quazip/default.nix :: Derivation for a dependency of ckb-next
  which wasn't already present in nixpkgs.
- overlay.nix :: An overlay of the two derivations, plus an
  experimental version of ckb-next.
- flake.nix :: A flake wrapping everything up, including NixOS modules
  that provide both the overlay and the definition of the ckb-next
  systemd service.
